  <p>You are what you eat. As glitter
    becomes a growing trend in rave culture the
    environment is suffering. The sparkle and glits
    gets washed away in the shower
    and makes its wake to the ocean where fish
    inhale it. The glitter is so tiny that
    it is also able to make its way through water
    filters and into our drinking water. At the end
    of the day we end up consuming the same glitter that
    completed our concert look.</p>
